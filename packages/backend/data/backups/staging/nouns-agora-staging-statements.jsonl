On Nouns in particular, we built Prop 87, helped design the Nouns Vision site, co-created Pronouns, and are now building Agora. Previously, I was a designer and early employee for four years at Coinbase. Below are a summary of my main views, though I'm also generally open to supporting initiatives outside of them under the right circumstances. \\\\n\\\\n**Fund extremely ambitious proposals**\\\\nToday, Nouns is highly regarded within a small community, but not yet known in the wider world. In order for the project to achieve its true potential and rival something like a Disney, Nouns DAO needs to grow by several orders of magnitude.\\\\n\\\\nTo do so, we need to increase our risk and size when it comes to funding – finding and investing in more initiatives like Prop House, which have the potential to be bigger than Nouns itself. Tactically, this means routing more funding through prop house for smaller initiatives to widen the funnel of builders, and using onchain gov to selectively but ambitiously fund builders with a track record.\\\\n\\\\n**Invest in governance efficacy**\\\\nIn order to up risk and size, we need to get a lot better at decision making. At a certain scale, we start competing against the best allocators at VCs and companies. How do we attract, identify and retain the best builders? I believe this must be done via deep investments in our capacity to make decisions quickly and well via a combination of funding contributors and constantly improving our tooling.\\\\n\\\\n**Impact = sustainability**\\\\nWe're not going to become meaningfully more sustainable by saving a few ETH here and there.

My honest opinion is that the DAO tends to overspend in North America, some deliverables could be done cheaper elsewhere for the same result. \\\\n\\\\nI also think that the dao could increase its investments in ETH/NFT IRL events. There is a huge untapped potential for sponsoring hackathons, attracting talented builders to the nouns community and giving seed funding via the dao (which would complement today's revenue streams, and bring the dao to another dimension). \\\\n\\\\nAnd I am also in love with public goods as I am currently learning SQL from cc0 learning materials. If the points mentioned above resonate with you and if you are looking for a delegate, give me your delegation and I will be very active representing you (and extremely grateful). \\\",\\n\\t\\\"topIssues\\\": [\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"type\\\": \\\"treasury\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"value\\\": \\\"we need to plant seeds\\\"\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"type\\\": \\\"proliferation\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"value\\\": \\\"Nouns popularity can grow as fast as Von dutch (minus Christian Audigier)\\\"\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t],\\n\\t\\\"mostValuableProposals\\\": [\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"number\\\": 95\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"number\\\": 18\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"number\\\": 22\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"number\\\": 52\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"number\\\": 101\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"number\\\": 119\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"number\\\": 139\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"number\\\": 65\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t],\\n\\t\\\"leastValuableProposals\\\": [\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"number\\\": 100\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"number\\\": 135\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t],\\n\\t\\\"twitter\\\": \\\"@ClubNotaro\\\",\\n\\t\\\"discord\\\": \\\"!
