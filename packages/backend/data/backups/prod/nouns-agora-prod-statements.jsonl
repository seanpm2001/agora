My role as delegate started when I asked inactive DAO memebrs to delegate me their vote over the summer, and today **I am one of the largest delegates in the DAO.**\\\\n\\\\n### My Philosophy on Delegation\\\\nSimply put, as exciting and fun as it is to work on Nouns, governance is work. I have been fortunate enough to be able to spend the majority of my time working on Nouns, and be compensated to do so by the DAO, for over a year.\\\\n\\\\nI do this because I think that Nouns is the single most exciting project going on in crypto today. I have had a front row seat to watch this DAO grow, change, and evolve over the last year. Our decentralized organization has rapidly scaled, not just in the number members, but in the overall project scope and diversity of opinion of Nouners. Whereas a year ago there used to be quiet days where not much happened, it is now challenging to keep up with every channel in the Discord these days.\\\\n\\\\nAs the DAO‚Äôs growth accelerates, keeping up on everything that is going on in the DAO is effectively a full time job.\\\\n\\\\nMost Nouners are extremely successful and busy people. That, combined with the scale and complexity of everything that happens day to day, makes it unrealistic to expect that all Nouners will have the time to make informed decisions on every matter in the DAO.\\\\n\\\\nFor that reason, I would like to offer my services as a delegate to any Noun owner. I have been one of the most active members of this DAO since inception, and **as your delegate, I will steward your vote in the best interests of both Nouns DAO and the future value of your investment.**\\\\n\\\\n### Positions\\\\nI support [Nounish](https://i.imgur.com/X5fWj6W.png) builders and proposals. I encourage passion and authenticity - I want to let people who are inspired by nouns be unrestrained to build out their vision. Nouns is CC0 and permissionless by design.\\\\n\\\\nNounishness is an emergent value set, and we are best served by letting people enjoy and adopt it however they wish, and encouraging passionaite creatives to build their Nounish vision however they want.\\\\n\\\\nYES:\\\\n\\\\n* User generated content - podcasts, twitter spaces, contests\\\\n* Internet-native content - viral videos, social media, memes\\\\n* Builders - technical tools, analytics, data, AI\\\\n* Public Goods - making the world a better place\\\\n* Ubiquity and ambiguity of the meme - Nouns is an emergent value set.

Below are a summary of my main views, though I'm also generally open to supporting initiatives outside of them under the right circumstances. \\\\n\\\\n**Fund extremely ambitious proposals**\\\\nToday, Nouns is highly regarded within a small community, but not yet known in the wider world. In order for the project to achieve its true potential and rival something like a Disney, Nouns DAO needs to grow by several orders of magnitude.\\\\n\\\\nTo do so, we need to increase our risk and size when it comes to funding ‚Äì finding and investing in more initiatives like Prop House, which have the potential to be bigger than Nouns itself. Tactically, this means routing more funding through prop house for smaller initiatives to widen the funnel of builders, and using onchain gov to selectively but ambitiously fund builders with a track record.\\\\n\\\\n**Invest in governance efficacy**\\\\nIn order to up risk and size, we need to get a lot better at decision making. At a certain scale, we start competing against the best allocators at VCs and companies. How do we attract, identify and retain the best builders? I believe this must be done via deep investments in our capacity to make decisions quickly and well via a combination of funding contributors and constantly improving our tooling.\\\\n\\\\n**Impact = sustainability**\\\\nWe're not going to become meaningfully more sustainable by saving a few ETH here and there.

I also believe the dao could experiment with \\\\\\\"having one noun out of X nouns\\\\\\\" given to the best nouns builder.\\\\n\\\\nI also think that the dao could increase its investments in ETH/NFT IRL events. There is a huge untapped potential for sponsoring hackathons, attracting talented builders to the nouns community and giving seed funding via the dao (which would complement today's revenue streams, and bring the dao to another dimension). \\\\n\\\\nAnd I am also in love with public goods as I am currently learning SQL from cc0 learning materials.
