Nouns DAO must set the example of excellence. I will vote to build that example.\\\\n\\\\n**Description**\\\\nToday, proliferating the Nouns meme has taken as many forms as the Nouns community can come up with. The collective creativity is phenomenal to see.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, as more Nouns forks and subDAOs come to light (this number will rapidly increase with the launch of Nouns Builder), Nouns will be looked to as the model for operational excellence, whether we like it or not. The Nouns meme will proliferate simply due to the fact that other communities will be incentivized to be Nounish, as it will be viewed as the best way forward due to the DAO's success.\\\\n\\\\nMy work at Forefront is focused on tokenized communities: DAOs focused on funding community projects to proliferate a common meme, of which Nouns is currently the quintessential example. Tokenized communities might be Nouns forks, but they might also have fundamentally different economic models than Nouns DAO (e.g. not auctioning X-a-day NFTs) while still trying to fund projects in pursuit of a common meme.\\\\n\\\\nThis is extremely important to highlight: if Nouns DAO wants to maintain its position as the example of an excellent tokenized community, the DAO will need to focus less on the noggles, and more on operational experimentation and excellence.\\\\n\\\\nEssentially, I believe that Nouns DAO must continue to experiment and grow to maintain its status as the \\\\\\\"best\\\\\\\" tokenized community. In doing so, our meme will be proliferated simply because other tokenized communities will look to us as an example, despite the fact that cultural production might be happening in these derivative communities.\\\\n\\\\n**I will use my Nouns votes to support experimentation with the Nouns model, operational excellence (e.g. more groundbreaking tools like Prop House), and uplifting other tokenized communities who will then proliferate the Nouns meme by emulating our great work.**\\\",\\n\\t\\\"topIssues\\\": [\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"type\\\": \\\"treasury\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"value\\\": \\\"\\\"\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"type\\\": \\\"proliferation\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"value\\\": \\\"\\\"\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t],\\n\\t\\\"mostValuableProposals\\\": [\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"number\\\": 105\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"number\\\": 154\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"number\\\": 156\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"number\\\": 122\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"number\\\": 84\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t],\\n\\t\\\"leastValuableProposals\\\": [\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"number\\\": 129\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"number\\\": 136\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"number\\\": 138\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\"number\\\": 95\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t],\\n\\t\\\"twitter\\\": \\\"@jaesmail\\\",\\n\\t\\\"discord\\\": \\\"jihad#8195\\\",\\n\\t\\\"openToSponsoringProposals\\\": \\\"yes\\\"\\n}\",\"signature\":\"0x1939dbcb34c28aa68943942dc64a478cb1e1e7e092511711cdda589da3f338de5d1d6a1411b02ea86852642b2ae243c661cd56496582640377271dea4797f7711b\",\"signatureType\":\"EOA\",\"updatedAt\":1666310826146}","retrievedAt":1666816931415,"key":{"name":"0x70ece45cdc64a768f936ccb8ac851578251363e3"}}

My role as delegate started when I asked inactive DAO memebrs to delegate me their vote over the summer, and today **I am one of the largest delegates in the DAO.**\\\\n\\\\n### My Philosophy on Delegation\\\\nSimply put, as exciting and fun as it is to work on Nouns, governance is work. I have been fortunate enough to be able to spend the majority of my time working on Nouns, and be compensated to do so by the DAO, for over a year.\\\\n\\\\nI do this because I think that Nouns is the single most exciting project going on in crypto today. I have had a front row seat to watch this DAO grow, change, and evolve over the last year. Our decentralized organization has rapidly scaled, not just in the number members, but in the overall project scope and diversity of opinion of Nouners. Whereas a year ago there used to be quiet days where not much happened, it is now challenging to keep up with every channel in the Discord these days.\\\\n\\\\nAs the DAO‚Äôs growth accelerates, keeping up on everything that is going on in the DAO is effectively a full time job.\\\\n\\\\nMost Nouners are extremely successful and busy people. That, combined with the scale and complexity of everything that happens day to day, makes it unrealistic to expect that all Nouners will have the time to make informed decisions on every matter in the DAO.\\\\n\\\\nFor that reason, I would like to offer my services as a delegate to any Noun owner. I have been one of the most active members of this DAO since inception, and **as your delegate, I will steward your vote in the best interests of both Nouns DAO and the future value of your investment.**\\\\n\\\\n### Positions\\\\nI support [Nounish](https://i.imgur.com/X5fWj6W.png) builders and proposals. I encourage passion and authenticity - I want to let people who are inspired by nouns be unrestrained to build out their vision.

Below are a summary of my main views, though I'm also generally open to supporting initiatives outside of them under the right circumstances. \\\\n\\\\n**Fund extremely ambitious proposals**\\\\nToday, Nouns is highly regarded within a small community, but not yet known in the wider world. In order for the project to achieve its true potential and rival something like a Disney, Nouns DAO needs to grow by several orders of magnitude.\\\\n\\\\nTo do so, we need to increase our risk and size when it comes to funding ‚Äì finding and investing in more initiatives like Prop House, which have the potential to be bigger than Nouns itself. Tactically, this means routing more funding through prop house for smaller initiatives to widen the funnel of builders, and using onchain gov to selectively but ambitiously fund builders with a track record.\\\\n\\\\n**Invest in governance efficacy**\\\\nIn order to up risk and size, we need to get a lot better at decision making. At a certain scale, we start competing against the best allocators at VCs and companies. How do we attract, identify and retain the best builders? I believe this must be done via deep investments in our capacity to make decisions quickly and well via a combination of funding contributors and constantly improving our tooling.\\\\n\\\\n**Impact = sustainability**\\\\nWe're not going to become meaningfully more sustainable by saving a few ETH here and there.
